# Neural Network Written in C

### Project Overview:
The goal of this repository is to create a Neural Network in the C programming language. Why? 
To gain a greater understanding of underlying computer hardware and reinforce my understanding 
of backpropagation and what neural networks are from a linear algebra perspective. 

I am new to writing C, so I imagine this will be a fairly intensive process to figure out how 
to go about this, so expect rapid CI/CD within this repository. That said: my first priority 
is to develop a representation of a neural net that is capable of training and running forward
passes. I plan to implement reverse mode auto-dif, though, this will be the most challenging 
task, I assume. So for the initial statge sof this project, I will stick to using the limit 
definition of the derivative to compute gradients, then implment true backprop later.

### What Net Specifically? 
At this stage, I am planning to write the code for a simple multi layer perceptron. Eventually,
I think a cool project would be to write a convolution network. Probably in GoLang though.
